### Gift Card enhancements

The following enhancements are proposed for the gift cards displayed on the /gifts page in Grid View:

1. Should display brief details regarding linked entities, such as Recipient, List(s), etc.
   - each should be represented by a small icon with a tooltip on hover showing the entity type and name, and being clickable to open that entity's modal.
2. Should have a small button in the bottom right to "Mark as Purchased", which marks the gift as purchased without needing to open the modal.
3. Should have a small icon in the top right with a hyperlink that opens the Product URL in a new tab, only rendering if the link is available.
