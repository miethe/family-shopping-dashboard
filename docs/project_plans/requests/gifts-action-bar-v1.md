# Gifts Enhancements - Action Bar v1

**Date:** December 22, 2025

## Ideas

On the /gifts page, there are several QoL enhancements which we should add as functions to the "Action Bar", the bottom section of each Gift card in the grid view, where the "Assign" button is currently located:

1. `Update Status` - In addition to the quick purchase button, this allows users to set the status to any of the 4 fields. This should function and look similar to the "Assign" button.
2. `+ List` - Add the gift to 1 or more Lists, or add a new List via simple dialog. Again should be similar to the `Assign` button.
3. `Assign` button and all similar should allow multi-select, only closing once the user clicks off the menu, or navigates away (after a delay of a few seconds).

Additional /gifts enhancements on the Gift Cards:

4. Clicking the price (including the "No price" placeholder when no price is available) should open a dialog to allow the user to input a price, displaying the current price if already set.
5. Clicking the status chip (ie "Purchased") should set a filter on the page for that status, displaying all gifts matching that status.
6. Clicking a Person avatar on the card should do similar to #5, filtering by gifts assigned to that person as recipient.
7. We should add a toggle to all gifts which is "From Santa". If toggled, the Gift Card should display a cute little Santa icon, indicating it is coming from Santa. There should be a tooltip on hover indicating the same.
