# Identified Bugs and Enhancements

**Date:** 2025-12-02

## Listed Items

1. When viewing a User modal, the "Hero" section is currently cut-off at the bottom, making it impossible to see the full avatar. The modal should be made taller, and the Hero section should be adjusted to ensure the avatar is always fully visible with expected vertical padding via scaling to fit dynamic screen sizes.
2. On the /people page, the Recipient Cards displaying each person should add their current age, their birthday (month and day), an 'x/y' count of gifts assigned vs. gifts needed, and a set of attached lists. If there are more lists than can fit, it should show a '+N' indicator with a tooltip on hover to show the full list.
    - If a Recipient has no assigned gifts, the card should visually indicate this with a subtle highlight or icon to prompt users to add gifts for that person.
    - Users should be able to click on the name of a List to open the modal for that list.
    - When users click on the gift count on the Recipient Card, it should open the /gifts page filtered to show only gifts assigned to that Recipient.
3. Lists should be able to be attached to Recipients and Occasions. There should be fields for both on List creation and editing flows. There should also be the option to attach a list on the creation/editing flows for Recipients and Occasions.
4. /gifts page should support filtering by Recipient, Status, Lists, and Occasion. The filter UI should allow multi-select for both fields, and the selected filters should be clearly displayed above the gift list with the ability to remove individual filters or clear all at once.
5. Gifts should be able to be attached to Recipients, Occasions, and Lists. There should be fields for all three on Gift creation and editing flows.
6. All entity modals (Gifts, Recipients, Occasions, Lists) should have a standardized tabbed design, with each having a mix of unique and shared tabs:
    - For now, all should have at least Overview, Linked Entities, History, with Overview being the default tab containing all primary information.
7. There is currently no method to edit or delete Recipients, Occasions, or Lists (can edit) once created. Each entity modal should have Edit and Delete buttons in the modal and detail page. The Edit button opens a modal to update all fields, while the Delete button prompts for confirmation before removing the entity.
